Why another blog?

Well, two reasons. I want to explain myself a bit, so I'll keep it short and simple for now.

#### There are two reasons for creating a Dev blog

* One is the obvious reason of separating normal blog posts with the more techy ones. To be fair, I needed a small change in layout anyway, and this theme and setup seemed awesome at the time.

* Secondly, I've been posting a lot on Facebook, letting the world know on what I'm learning and my opinions and stuff... And some people suggested I start a blog instead â€“ hint taken, I'll spamming your walls :)

#### And well, we're here

To be perfectly frank, I'll either spam the hell out of this blog, or ignore it like I usually do.
